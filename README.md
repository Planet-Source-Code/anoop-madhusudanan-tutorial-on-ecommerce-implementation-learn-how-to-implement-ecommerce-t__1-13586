### Description

Well, I think that this one is the most

valuable and lengthy article ever posted to Planet-Source-Code. Anyway,

download this and decide it yourself. A very neatly designed HTML tutorial and three

full fledged projects are there. Just say bye to your uncertainty to internet in

general, and ECommerce in particular.

<p>After reading this article, you can:</p>

<ul>

<li>Get the basic concepts of making

ECommerce transactions from ASP/VB projects.</li>

<li>Get the concept of developing and

implementing COM (Component Object Model) DLLs (Dynamic Link Library) for

ASP applications.</li>

<li>Learn how to write socket based

servers</li>

<li>Learn how to use wrappers - in this

case, a socket wrapper for using windows sockets from ASP.</li>

<li>Get some killer logic to put in your

next project :-)</li>

</ul>

<p>Don't get afraid even if you can't

understand anything from the description. Of course, I prepared the whole

article very plainly - sticking to the basics; and I am sure than any one with a

very basic knowledge of VB and ASP can follow this very easily. Thanks for

already making me a winner two-three times, and I expect it again from you. Because, I took nearly 9-10 hours to design and develop the whole thing.
